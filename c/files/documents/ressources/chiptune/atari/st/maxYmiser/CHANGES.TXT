v1.14b
------
Internal version

 - Graceful handling of  timer disabling
    in dynamic  timer   allocation  (505
    request)

 - Attempt fix for  the  classic  falcon
    fileselector  bug (505 request, help
    from No/Escape - cheers!)

 - Minor opimisation  to  replay routine

 - Bug fix to binary version of replayer

 - Bug fix 'instrument  clear'  shortcut

 - Bug fix to  pattern  packing routines
    allows pattern  $FF  to be used with
    no crashing (Divag/Dubmood report)

 - Limited maximum pattern number to $EF
    for future expansion

 - Small change to allow nonsample tunes
    to  work in  emulated  players  like
    WinJAM etc.  Doesn't  count as a bug
    fix :))
    
 - Attempt bug fix  for  realtime  timer
    adjustment (505 report)
 

v1.13a
------
Release vesrion

 - Fixed bug  preventing  0 DMA channels
    falcon (frequent/ephi bug report)

 - Improved   'foreground'   function  a
    little


v1.13
-----
Release version

 - Added DMA  replay  rate  reference in
    the help  menu.   Tweaked  microwire
    help text.


v1.12e
------
Internal version

 - Disabled  timer  interrupts  in  ACIA
    interrupt handler. Hopefully this is
    the  final  fix   to  the  MIDI  and
    spurious keyboard press issues noted
    by divag and dma-sc. My previous fix
    attempts  have  not  been  wasted ;)
    They made  the  ACIA  routine pretty
    fast  -  ok so  i  can  squeeze more
    speed,  but not that much.  Now that
    interrupts are  disabled during ACIA
    SID quality is reduced a little when
    using the mouse,  keyboard and MIDI,
    but the fast  routine minimises this
    in practical situations (i hope ;) )

 - Fixed bug when  loading  old SNDH and
    MYV on the 1Mb version.

 - Fixed dirty  evil  YM  digidrum bug I
    just discovered


v1.12d
------
Internal version

 - Disabled  pattern  selection  in  jam
    song mode,  for  safety and laziness
    reasons :)

 - Attempted   spurious   keypress   fix
    (dma-sc bug complaint)


v1.12c
------
Internal version

 - Added sample  truncation if digi size
    is too big.   This  allows  for safe
    creation of  maxymiser versions with
    more or less sample memory.

 - Fix overflow  errors on sample adjust
    which lead to  brutal crashing  (505
    bug report)


v1.12b
------
Internal version

 - Added semitone and fine tuning sample
    editing function (505 request)

 - Added flush  cache  for  030  cpus to
    fix  potential  problems  with  self
    generating and  self relocating code
    (actually none have been observed)

 - Fixed pattern pointer table generator
    to work with  variable  sample start
    offset,   so  no  more weird crashes
    when trimming the sample start.

 - Fixed FDI support,  now  working with
    STe DMA  channels at 44.1 and 48kHz,
    and SPDIF output  toggle  between YM
    and DMA.

 - Added flush  cache  for  060  cpus to
    fix FDI frequency  switching problem
    caused by self generating code.


v1.12
-----
Internal version

 - Added  octave   +/-   sample  editing
    function.   The  octave down uses an
    linear interpolation  alogorithm for
    better audio quality

 - Added trimmer for sample start

 - Attempted to  fix  midi  activity bug
    whilst  loading  the  software (Nemo
    request)

 - Fixed keyboard  adjustment of current
    digi sample

 - Fixed RGB resolution switch on Falcon
    with boosted bus

 - Fixed DMA routines  to work on Falcon
    (stereo 16bit 49khz) this breaks the
    SP-DIF  support,   but  I'll  fix it
    later

 - Shortened   fade   in/out  times  for
    impatient people - hi 505!! ;)))

 - Shortened intro logo display time for
    impatient people - hi Frequent!! :P

 - Fixed master volume and pan microwire
    code for Falcon

 - Extended maximum sample size limit to
    32k (505 request)


v1.11
-----
Internal version

 - Renabled ste dma
 
 - Fixed jittery 2nd  channel when 2 dma
    channels are active (dma-sc request)

    work in jam sequencing mode

 - Fixed keyboard  shortcuts  to work in
    jam mode

 - Modifed song  editor  a  bit  for jam
    mode, no major changes however

 - Optimised pattern number display rout
    and changed for jam mode

 - Added save,  sign/unsign  and  length
    adjustment to sample editor


v1.10
-----
Internal version
 
 - Another optimisation to MIDI routines
    for attempted stuck note fix

 - Display pattern/song mode

 - Fix jump to  column keyboard shortcut

 - Fixed 0/1/2 dma channel selection and
    sample editing  problems,   now much
    smoother

 - Fixed insert  and  backspace  keys to
    work on 5 channels (dma-sc request)

 - Temporarily disabled ste dma for this
    test version


v1.09
-----
Internal version

 - Updated MIDI to  work with 5 channels
    and also allow to  disable midi on a
    channel

 - Added toggle between  1 and 2 ste dma
    channels

 - Attempted  to  remove   delay  before
    beginning playback  with a dma sound
    system pre-initialisation


v1.08
-----
Internal version

 - After trying some mixing algorithms I
    finally settled  on the simplest for
    memory reasons. So maxYMiser has two
    working DMA channels now.


v1.07
-----
Internal version

 - Reduced  maximum  digidrum  frequency
    back to 25kHz

 - Retain path  between  disk operations
    (Frequent request)

 - Added  some   lame   sample   editing
    functions in the  S.E.Extension menu

 - Converted all  editing functions to 5
    channels - nightmare!! ;)


v1.06b
------
Internal version

 - Fixed a microwire stability bug


v1.06
-----
Internal version

 - Ignoring empty samples in DMA routine

 - Fixed  small   bug   in  mute  on/off
    shortcuts

 - Implemented code generated resampling
    algorithm,  and  reduced sample rate
    to 25033Hz - big performance boost!!

 - Modified STe  code  to  be compatible
    with TT machines (untested)

 - Added shortcuts to select digi sounds
    when on STe DMA channel

 - Added 'U' tracker command.  This code
    allows  creative  use  of  the STe's
    LMC1992  stereo   tone  and   volume
    circuit:

    U00->U0C      Set bass     (U06=0db)
    U10->U1C      Set treble   (U16=0db)
    U80->UA0      Set master volume
    UC0->UD0->UE0 Set panning position

    'U' stands for  the  greek letter mu
    which is often  used  for 'micro' as
    in 'microwire'...   the interface to
    the LMC1992 chip :)


v1.05
-----
Internal version

 - Single DMA  channel  with  volume and
    pitch implemented

 - Display   last   used   pattern   and
    sequence (Nemo request)


v1.04
-----
Internal version

 - Added config option  to switch on and
    off dma  sound  in  the editor,  and
    changed  the  editing  functions  to
    work  properly  with  this   (Dma Sc
    request)

 - Saving MIDI  settings  in  .cnf  file
    (Sidabitball request)


v1.03
-----
Internal version

 - Fixed all functions to work with four
    channels

 - Changes YM3/DMA toggle to a scrolling
    operation

 - Added more  shortcuts  for  selecting
    instruments (Divag request)

 - Added  possibility  to  auto-load all
    filetypes .MYI, .MYS, .MYV, .SND etc
    from the file DEFAULT.??? Needed big
    changes   to   the   file   handling
    functions.

 - Changed pattern/song  position select
    shortcuts to be more logical

 - Moved expand/shrink  functions to the
    advanced edit menu

 - Added toggle for  the jam mode on the
    normal menu (and F10 shortcut)

 - Added Shift+N and Ctrl+N shortcuts to
    get new patterns


v1.02
-----
Internal version

 - Changed   behaviour  of  song/pattern
    play/record keys  to  allow punch in
    and  out   without   retriggering  a
    playing  pattern.   Better  for live
    jamming around.   To stop complaints
    menu buttons work as previous.

 - Changed  behaviour  of  channel mutes
    and solos.   Now functions closer to
    Fasttracker 2, but the main thing is
    that its now possible to user jam on
    a muted channel  for realtime fun ;)

 - Added  keyboard  shortcuts  for track
    mute and unmute -  Shift + Q, W or E

 - Added a special mode to make entering
    drum sounds and  effects more easily
    this is activated with F9. With this
    mode active each key triggers middle
    C on a different instrument. In this
    this  mode  releasing  a  key has no
    effect.

 - Special drum mode now also active for
    midi input!   It is activated in the
    editor by selecting  voice $DD for a
    particular midi channel by scrolling
    above $20, or below $01. It can also
    be  activated   over   midi  with  a
    program change above voice $20.   So
    maxYMiser  is  now  compatible  with
    midi drum pads - boo yeah ;)

 - Increased  range  of  digidrum replay
    frequencies.  In preparation for STe
    DMA sound the  upper  limit is now a
    little over  50kHz,  and inspired by
    Ray's Wolf  3D  conversion the lower
    limit is now just 3kHz.

 - New MYI and MYV format files for 8bit
    digidrums.  Any old 4bit sample data
    which is loaded in is reconverted to
    8bit  precision.  Detects  this with
    the new MYM1DIGI tag.

 - Added compiler  variable  for maximum
    sample length.

 - Added  extra  keyboard  shortcuts for
    various pattern/song play options as
    requested by Dma-Sc.

 - Modified  the  look  of  the  GUI  to
    include  a  fourth   STe  DMA  sound
    channel.   The  new functions do not
    work so far :)   F10 toggles between
    displaying Ch3 and the STe DMA. Made
    fix for Alt+QWER shortcut.


v1.01
-----
Internal version

 - Cleaned up  MIDI  routines for future
    expansion

 - Attempted fix  for  stuck  MIDI notes
    (divag request)

v1.00
-----
Release version

- Removed a YM  special  timer effect so
   Outline   version   will   always  be
   unique

- Fixed  bug   in   midi  input  support
   related   to   sounds   using   timer
   effects

- Included  'Chipping 4 Ca$h'  demo song
   by gwEm and Dma-Sc


v0.99
